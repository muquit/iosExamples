A port of WorldFacts to use SQLite and FMDB. The original WorldFacts at 
https://github.com/kharrison/CodeExamples/tree/master/WorldFacts uses
Core Data.

I converted data from countries.plist to SQL statements and created the
countries.sqlite.

From this app you can learn:
  * Read data from SQLite with ease using FMDM.
  * UITableView with dynamic sections and index.
  * Filtered search.
